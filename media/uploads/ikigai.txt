What I have understood?

1. Ikigai talks about 4 things and the combination of them:
a) What You are good at?
b) What You are happy doing?
c) What World needs?
d) What you can earn with?

2. Most difficult of the 4 is (d) What you can earn with?

3. First divide into two groups: (a, b) and (d).

4. If you are currently having a job and it is fulfilling your current daily expenses and
a) You are happy with it.
b) You are not happy with it.

5. If 4(a), then work on increasing your salary, position and authority in it.

6. If 4(b), then stay hold on to that job, be genuine and do your job.
But don't try to be the best in it. Don't try to work on increasing the existing 50k salary to 100k or 150k.
Just do your job perfectly.
Take time and start working on what you like the most. (Dancing, Singing, Writing, Painting, and infinity whatever it might be, Fitness trainer in my case)
Don't expect to monetize from what you are good at from the Day 1.
Work on it for 2, or 3 or 5 years and at one point you will be able to unlock the key of monetizing what you love doing.
Then you can alvida the existing job slowly and move to what you love doing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. Don't expect to monetize on doing what you love from Day 1.
2. Be loyal to your existing job. That is helping your 5 fingers go into your mouth 3 times & is taking care of your family.
3. It takes a good fucking may be 5 years of time to excel and to unlock yourself in what you love.
4. Consistency pays off.
5. Networking pays off.
6. Anybody can do it.

ASSUMPTION:
1. Your current job is paying your current expenses. You are not in a deficit.
